This hack assumes you already have Firefox installed in /Applications.

To install drag "Firefox all spaces.app" to your applications etc.

First time you start create a new profile named "all spaces" and then
exit the profile manager. DONT delete your default profile!
Next time you start the "Firefox all spaces" application a new Firefox
window will appear.

To make the new window visible on all spaces you have to add the
Application in the "Expose & Spaces" preferences. Add it by
clicking the "+" and choose "Other..." and browse to the application.
It seams as this have to be done after each restart, don't know why.
